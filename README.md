# Password-Generator

## Description
The aim of this project was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

The application needs to...
Generate a password when the button is clicked.
Present a series of prompts for password criteria: Length of password (At least 10 characters but no more than 64), character types (Lowercase, uppercase, numeric and a selection of special characters).
Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The application can be accessed via an internet browser and the results can be seen in the console.
